It was my final game for CSE 102 igraphics project. It's nothing fancy but all the logics are self implemented and I am satisfied with what I pulled off. And it was fun working with igraphics(with few irritating momments because of the restriction of the library). Made it in 3 days. most of the work was done in the last 2 days before submission. So, the game aesthetics are quite bad as I didn't have enough time to choose or create these image files.
