It was my final game for CSE 102 igraphics project. It's nothing fancy but all the logics are self implemented and I am satisfied with what I pulled off. And it was fun working with igraphics(with few irritating momments because of the restriction of the library). It was created in 3 days. most of the work was done in the last 2 days before submission. So, the game aesthetics are quite bad as I didn't have enough time to choose or create these image files.
For juniors (in case) : The headerfile is good for adding music, sometimes the provided headerfiles doesn't work properly. In that case download this folder and paste your code here. And don't panic that you won't be able to do this project. If a noob like me can, so can you.
